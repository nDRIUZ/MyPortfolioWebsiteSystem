###About project
This is my first ever project developed on ASP.NET Core framework and I learned so much out of it!
Therefore, I would change quite a lot if I developed it right now.
* It's a bit of a messy code. User razor and MVC at the same time. Would definitely go blazor next time!
* There are exactly 0 comments in the code :/
* Oh my, such repetitive code!
* Put more heart into design! Maybe use adminLTE or something...
* I guess my variable names are quite a mess too...
